<h3>Assignment 5: Data Warehousing <small>due 8:30am March 2</small></h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> This assignment is a draft and incomplete. If you
begin working on this assignment, be aware that parts can still
change. This message will be removed once the assignment is
complete.</p>

<p>In this assignment you'll be hand-crafting Spark programs that
implement SQL queries in a data warehousing scenario. Various
SQL-on-Hadoop solutions share in providing an SQL query interface on
data stored in HDFS via an intermediate execution framework. For
example, Hive queries are "compiled" into MapReduce jobs; SparkSQL
queries rely on Spark processing primitives for query execution. In
this assignment, you'll play the role of mediating between SQL queries
and the underlying execution framework (Spark). In more detail, you'll
be given a series of SQL queries, and for each you'll have to
hand-craft a Spark program that corresponds to each query.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> You are not allowed to use the Dataframe API or
Spark SQL to complete this assignment. You must write code to manipulate raw RDDs.
Furthermore, you are not allowed to use <code>join</code> and
closely-related transformations in Spark for this assignment, because
otherwise it defeats the point of the exercise. The assignment will
guide you toward what we are looking for, but if you have any
questions as to what is allowed or not, ask!</p>

<p>We will be working with data from the TPC-H benchmark in this
assignment. The Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) is a
non-profit organization that defines various database benchmarks so
that database vendors can evaluate the performance of their products
fairly. TPC defines the "rules of the game", so to speak. TPC defines
various benchmarks, of which one is TPC-H, for evaluating ad-hoc
decision support systems in a data warehousing scenario. The current
version of the TPC-H benchmark is located
<a href="assignments/tpc-h_v2.17.1.pdf">here</a>. You'll want to skim
through this (long) document; the most important part is the
entity-relationship diagram of the data warehouse on page
13. Throughout the assignment you'll likely be referring to it, as it
will help you make sense of the queries you are running.</p>

<p>The TPC-H benchmark comes with a data generator, and we have
generated some data for
you <a href="assignments/TPC-H-0.1-TXT.tar.gz">here</a>
(<code>TPC-H-0.1-TXT.tar.gz</code>). For the first
part of the assignment where you will be working with Spark locally,
you will run your queries against this data.
Download and unpack the data above: you will see a number of text files,
each corresponding to a table in the TPC-H schema. The files are
delimited by <code>|</code>. You'll notice that some of the fields,
especially the text fields, are gibberish&mdash;that's normal, since
the data are randomly generated.</p>

<p>Implement the following seven SQL queries, running on
the <code>TPC-H-0.1-TXT</code> data. Each SQL query is
accompanied by a written description of what the query does; if there
are any ambiguities in the language, you can always assume that the
SQL query is correct. Each of your query will be a separate Spark
program. Put your code in the package
<code>ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5</code>, in the
same repo that you've been working in all semester. Since you'll be
writing Scala code, your source files should go into
<code>src/main/scala/ca/uwaterloo/cs/bigdata2017w/assignment5/</code>.</p>

<p><b>Q1:</b> How many items were shipped on a particular date? This corresponds to the following SQL query:

<pre>
select count(*) from lineitem where l_shipdate = 'YYYY-MM-DD';
</pre>

<p>Write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q1 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>the answer to the above SQL query will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed), in a line that matches
the following regular expression:</p>

<pre>
ANSWER=\d+
</pre>

<p>The output of the query can contain logging and debug information,
but there must be a line with the answer in <b>exactly</b> the above
format.</p>

<p>The value of the
<code>--input</code> argument is the directory that contains the
plain-text tables. The value of the <code>--date</code> argument
corresponds to the <code>l_shipdate</code> predicate in the where
clause in the SQL query. You need to anticipate dates of the
form <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, <code>YYYY-MM</code>, or
just <code>YYYY</code>, and your query needs to give the correct
answer depending on the date format. You can assume that a valid date
(in one of the above formats) is provided, so you do not need to
perform input validation.</p>

<p><b>Q2:</b> Which clerks were responsible for processing items that
were shipped on a particular date? List the first 20 by order
key. This corresponds to the following SQL query:</p>

<pre>
select o_clerk, o_orderkey from lineitem, orders
where
  l_orderkey = o_orderkey and
  l_shipdate = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
order by o_orderkey asc limit 20;
</pre>

<p>Write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q2 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>the answer to the above SQL query will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed), as a sequence of tuples
in the following format:</p>

<pre>
(o_clerk,o_orderkey)
(o_clerk,o_orderkey)
...
</pre>

<p>That is, each tuple is comma-delimited and surrounded by
parentheses. Everything described in <b>Q1</b> about dates applies
here as well.</p>

<p>In the design of this data warehouse, the <code>lineitem</code>
and <code>orders</code> tables are not likely to fit in
memory. Therefore, the only scalable join approach is the reduce-side
join. You must implement this join in Spark using
the <code>cogroup</code> transformation.</p>

<p><b>Q3:</b> What are the names of parts and suppliers of items
shipped on a particular date? List the first 20 by order key. This
corresponds to the following SQL query:</p>

<pre>
select l_orderkey, p_name, s_name from lineitem, part, supplier
where
  l_partkey = p_partkey and
  l_suppkey = s_suppkey and
  l_shipdate = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
order by l_orderkey asc limit 20;
</pre>

<p>Write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q3 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>the answer to the above SQL query will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed), as a sequence of tuples
in the following format:</p>

<pre>
(l_orderkey,p_name,s_name)
(l_orderkey,p_name,s_name)
...
</pre>

<p>That is, each tuple is comma-delimited and surrounded by
parentheses. Everything described in <b>Q1</b> about dates applies
here as well.</p>

<p>In the design of this data warehouse, it is assumed that
the <code>part</code> and <code>supplier</code> tables will fit in
memory. Therefore, it is possible to implement a hash join. For this
query, you must implement a hash join in Spark with broadcast
variables.</p>

<p><b>Q4:</b> How many items were shipped to each country on a
particular date? This corresponds to the following SQL query:</p>

<pre>
select n_nationkey, n_name, count(*) from lineitem, orders, customer, nation
where
  l_orderkey = o_orderkey and
  o_custkey = c_custkey and
  c_nationkey = n_nationkey and
  l_shipdate = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
group by n_nationkey, n_name
order by n_nationkey asc;
</pre>

<p>Write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q4 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>the answer to the above SQL query will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed). Format
the output in the same manner as with the above queries: one tuple per
line, where each tuple is comma-delimited and surrounded by
parentheses. Everything described in <b>Q1</b> about dates applies
here as well.</p>

<p>Implement this query with different join techniques as you see
fit. You can assume that the <code>lineitem</code>
and <code>orders</code> table will not fit in memory, but you can
assume that the <code>customer</code> and <code>nation</code> tables
will both fit in memory. For this query, the performance as well as
the scalability of your implementation will contribute to the
grade.</p>

<p><b>Q5:</b> This query represents a very simple end-to-end ad hoc
analysis task: Related to <b>Q4</b>, your boss has asked you to
compare shipments to Canada vs. the United States by month, given all
the data in the data warehouse. You think this request is best
fulfilled by a line graph, with two lines (one representing the US and
one representing Canada), where the <i>x</i>-axis is the year/month and
the <i>y</i> axis is the volume, i.e., <code>count(*)</code>.
Generate this graph for your boss.</p>

<p>First, write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q5 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT
</pre>

<p>the raw data necessary for the graph will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed).
Format the output in the same manner as with the above queries: one
tuple per line, where each tuple is comma-delimited and surrounded by
parentheses.</p>

<p>Next, create this actual graph: use whatever tool you are
comfortable with, e.g., Excel, gnuplot, etc.</p>

<p><b>Q6:</b> This is a slightly modified version of TPC-H Q1 "Pricing
Summary Report Query". This query reports the amount of business that
was billed, shipped, and returned:</p>

<pre>
select
  l_returnflag,
  l_linestatus,
  sum(l_quantity) as sum_qty,
  sum(l_extendedprice) as sum_base_price,
  sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) as sum_disc_price,
  sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)*(1+l_tax)) as sum_charge,
  avg(l_quantity) as avg_qty,
  avg(l_extendedprice) as avg_price,
  avg(l_discount) as avg_disc,
  count(*) as count_order
from lineitem
where
  l_shipdate = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
group by l_returnflag, l_linestatus;
</pre>

<p>Write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q6 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>the answer to the above SQL query will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed). Format
the output in the same manner as with the above queries: one tuple per
line, where each tuple is comma-delimited and surrounded by
parentheses. Everything described in <b>Q1</b> about dates applies
here as well.</p>

<p>Implement this query as efficiently as you can, using all of the
optimizations we discussed in lecture. You will only get full points
for this question if you exploit all the optimization opportunities
that are available.</p>

<p><b>Q7:</b> This is a slightly modified version of TPC-H Q3
"Shipping Priority Query".  This query retrieves the 10 unshipped
orders with the highest value:</p>

<pre>
select
  c_name,
  l_orderkey,
  sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) as revenue,
  o_orderdate,
  o_shippriority
from customer, orders, lineitem
where
  c_custkey = o_custkey and
  l_orderkey = o_orderkey and
  o_orderdate < "YYYY-MM-DD" and
  l_shipdate > "YYYY-MM-DD"
group by
  c_name,
  l_orderkey,
  o_orderdate,
  o_shippriority
order by
  revenue desc
limit 10;
</pre>

<p>Write a program such that when we execute the following
command:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5.Q7 \
   target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input TPC-H-0.1-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>the answer to the above SQL query will be printed to stdout (on the
console where the above command is executed).
Format the output in the same manner as with the above queries: one
tuple per line, where each tuple is comma-delimited and surrounded by
parentheses. Here you can assume that the date argument is only in the
format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> and that it is a valid date.</p>

<p>Implement this query as efficiently as you can, using all of the
optimizations we discussed in lecture. Plan joins as you see fit,
keeping in mind above assumptions on what will and will not fit in
memory. You will only get full points for this question if you exploit
all the optimization opportunities that are available.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Scaling up on Altiscale</h4>

<p>Once you get your implementation working and debugged in the Linux
environment, run your code on a larger TCP-H dataset, located on HDFS
at <code>/shared/cs489/data/TPC-H-10-TXT</code>. Make sure that all
seven queries above run correctly on this larger dataset.</p>

<p>On the Altiscale cluster, we will run your code with the following
command-line parameters (same for Q1-Q7):</p>

<pre>
my-spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.lintool.assignment5.Q1 --num-executors 10 --driver-memory 2g --executor-memory 2G \
 target/bigdata2017w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --input /shared/cs489/data/TPC-H-10-TXT --date '1996-01-01'
</pre>

<p>In this configuration, your programs shouldn't take more than a
couple of minutes. If it's taking more than five minutes, you're
probably doing something wrong.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> In your <code>my-spark-submit</code> script, make
sure you set <code>--deploy-mode client</code>. This will force the
driver to run on the client (i.e., workspace), so that you will see
the output of <code>println</code>. Otherwise, the driver will run on
an arbitrary cluster node, making stdout not directly visible.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Turning in the Assignment</h4>

<p>Please follow these instructions carefully!</p>

<p>Make sure your repo has the following items:</p>

<ul>

<li>Optional: put anything that you want to convey to us about your
implementation in <code>bigdata2017w/assignment5.md</code>.</li>

<li>Two files,
named <code>bigdata2017w/assignment5-Q5-small.pdf</code>
and <code>bigdata2017w/assignment5-Q5-large.pdf</code> that contains
the graphs for Q5 on the <code>TPC-H-0.1-TXT</code>
and <code>TPC-H-10-TXT</code> datasets, respectively. If you cannot
easily generate PDFs, the files should be some easily-viewable format,
e.g., <code>png</code>, <code>gif</code>, etc.</li>

<li>Your implementations for the queries should be in
package <code>ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2017w.assignment5</code>. There
should be at the minimum seven classes (Q1-Q7), but you may include
helper classes as you see fit.</li>

</ul>

<p>Make sure your implementation runs in the Linux student CS
environment on <code>TPC-H-0.1-TXT</code>, and on the Alitscale
cluster on the <code>TPC-H-10-TXT</code> data.</p>

<p>Specifically, we will clone your repo and use the below check
scripts: <b>(Note, this check scripts are drafts only, not ready for consumption)</b></p>

<ul>

<li><a href="assignments/check_assignment5_public_linux.py"><code>check_assignment5_public_linux.py</code></a>
in the Linux Student CS environment.</li>

<li><a href="assignments/check_assignment5_public_altiscale.py"><code>check_assignment5_public_altiscale.py</code></a>
on the Altiscale cluster.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you've done everything, commit to your repo and remember to
push back to origin. You should be able to see your edits in the web
interface. Before you consider the assignment "complete", we would
recommend that you verify everything above works by performing a clean
clone of your repo and run the public check scripts.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Grading</h4>

<p>The entire assignment is worth 100 points:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Getting your code to compile is worth 10 points (by now, these
  should be "free" points).</li>

  <li>For Q1-Q3, each query is worth 10 points: 5 points for a correct
  implementation that works in the Linux Student CS environment, 5
  points for a correct implementation that works on the Altiscale
  cluster.</li>

  <li>Q4 and Q5 are each worth 14 points: 7 points for a correct
  implementation that works in the Linux Student CS environment, 7
  points for a correct implementation that works on the Altiscale
  cluster.</li>

  <li>Q6 and Q7 are each worth 16 points: 8 points for a correct
  implementation that works in the Linux Student CS environment, 8
  points for a correct implementation that works on the Altiscale
  cluster.</li>

</ul>

<p>A working implementation means that your code gives the right
output according to our private check scripts, which will
contain <code>--date</code> parameters that are unknown to you (but
will nevertheless conform to our specifications above).</p>
